# Building Simplified Redis in Rust

## TODO
- [ ] Threads are currently used for concurrency. Do a benchmark thread vs tokio.
- [ ] Switch to tokio.


## Inspired by
- CodeCrafters
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).
  - Give them a try. In this challenge, you'll build a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
  basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. 
  - Along the way we'll learn about event loops, the Redis protocol, replication and more.
